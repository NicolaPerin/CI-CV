    Profile:
      - >
        MSc graduate in Data Science and Scientific Computing with practical experience in designing and deploying FAIR-oriented research data workflows. 
        Worked on the development of a containerised web platform integrated with distributed storage (Ceph/S3) and deployed in a Kubernetes (K3s) environment within an HPC data centre context. 
        BSc Physics graduate with experience analysing Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data, providing familiarity with space mission data products and scientific archive workflows.
    
    Experience:

      - company: Area Science Park
        position: Research Fellow
        start_date: 2025-06
        end_date:
        location: Trieste
        highlights:
          - Acted as a link between the data center operations team and electron microscopy researchers in the design and deployment of a data management platform aligned with NFFA-DI FAIR guidelines, 
            implementing workflows that extract and normalise microscope metadata into the NeXus (HDF5) NXem schema to support archival integration and reuse
          - Integrated S3-compatible object storage (Ceph RGW) and OIDC-based authentication (Authentik) into a containerized Django web application, 
            deployed on Kubernetes in a virtualised replica of the production HPC infrastructure that serves as a staging environment.

      - company: Area Science Park
        position: Curricular Internship
        start_date: 2024-03
        end_date: 2024-07
        location: Trieste
        highlights:
          - Developed containerized environments (Podman) with automated fio-based I/O benchmark pipelines,
            executed via shell scripts and Jenkins CI across multiple Fedora configurations, ensuring reproducible results across platforms.
          - Analysed benchmark results in a Jupyter notebook (IOPS, bandwidth, CPU utilisation, latency); wrote a Lua module for fio to enable loading it as an environment module on the HPC cluster.
